Hello incoming 15L students!
This blog post will be a tutorial about how to log into your course-speical account on `ieng6` (the UCSD basement server).

## Step 1: *Installing VScode*
Go to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download and install it on your device.

## Step 2: *Remotely Connecting*
Here we will be connecting VScode to a remote device over the Internet!

Since I'm operating on Windows, I'll be giving instructions for Window users (my apologies to other users reading this). 

1. Install [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse) using the link attached.
2. Look up your course-specific account for CSE15L : [CSE15L-Account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
3. Open your terminal in VSCode using the Terminal menu and type in a `ssh` command replacing my account with your own.

    ` $ ssh cs15lwi22akz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

    Continue connecting by pressing "yes", enter your password and you should get something like this
