---

My lab group ***(Fire Salamander)*** tried to come up with some failure-inducing inputs in lab 3 and we both failed (pun intended?) and succeeded in making  `MarkdownParse.java` return an error. 

We also got some expected outputs as well wwhen trying to find a sample failure-inducing input. 

Here are some of the code changes that ***Fire Salamander*** worked on in order to fix a bug : 
Since `MarkdownParse.java` reads whatever is between the ` ( , ) , [ , ] ` we decided to add and remove certain numbers of each.


these should be stored as commits on someone's repository.


## Code Change 1 : *Something*

- show a screenshot of the code change difference from github
- link to the test file for a failure-inducing input that prompted you to make that change
- show the symptom of that filure-inducing input by showing the output of running the file at the command line for the version where it was failing (this should also be in the commit message history)
- write 2-3 sentences describing the relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the filure-inducing input



## Code Change 2 : *An Infinite Loop*
We were working on debugging Erwin's last testing case. The
