## Snippet 1: 

- Decide on what it should produce by either VScode previerw or the CommonMark demo site

- Show the code in `MarkdownParseTest.java` for how you turned it into a test

- For **my implementation** the corresponding output when running the tests

(if passed) - say so
(if failed) - show the specific part of JUnit output that shows failure

> This was my `.ssh/config` file just following the directions from Week 5.
I chose to edit it with VScode in order to be consistent since we've been using VScode in this class.

## My Implementation:

- Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

- Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.

- Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
