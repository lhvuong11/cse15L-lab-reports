# **LAB REPORT 5**

![Image](comp.jpg) 

---

***Choose any 2 tests from the 652 commonmark-spec tests where your implementation had different answers than the implementation provided***

The tests with different answers should correspond to **different bugs** - that is, you couldn't easily fix both with one code change.

---
## Bug #1: 
![Image](s1.jpg)

- How did you find the tests with different results (Did you use `diff` on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)

- Describe which implementation is correct, or if you think *neither* is correct, by showing both actual outputs and indicating what the expected output is
- For the implementation that's not correct (or choose one if both are incorrect), describe the bug. You don't have to provide a fix, but you should be specific about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should be fixed
